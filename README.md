COVID19-Tracker
In this project, learners will build a data analysis and reporting notebook (or app) that tracks global COVID-19 trends. The project will analyze cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time. Learners will clean and process real-world data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate insights, and visualize trends using Python data tools.

Data collection - Used the cleaned CSV from Our World in Data (easy to load with pandas).

Project Objectives:

✅ Import and clean COVID-19 global data

✅ Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)

✅ Compare metrics across countries/regions

✅ Visualize trends with charts and maps

✅ Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report

Tools Used: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and VS Code.

Pandas is for Data Loading, and data cleaning.

Matplotlib and seaborn is for Data Visualizations like creating charts, Histograms.
